#+TODO: TODO | DONE HOLD

* TODO Remove uses of `:after` from use-packages
  [2017-07-14 Fri 01:56]
  `(require '*)` is better and probably what I actually want
** TODO Figure out `:ensure`
Bad documentation imo

* DONE Delete commented old configs in init.el
* DONE Get orgmode to recognise C-RET to insert headings in normal mode
  Rebound "RET" instead, since in terminals C-RET gets aliased to RET anyway
* TODO Bind org-capture-refile to an ex-command
* TODO Figure out `org-agenda`
* TODO Pass arguments to helm search functions in `:vsp`
* TODO Figure out newline-and-indent
It seems more reliable for what I want, *but* it breaks term-mode (makes it so
we can't enter commands)
* TODO Get `/` and `?` searches to work with `C-w`
I read somewhere that isearch was the backend and that isearch cheats using
the echo area, instead of the minibuffer. This might be a problem

* DONE `setf` vs `setq`
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/869529/difference-between-set-setq-and-setf-in-common-lisp

* TODO Customise org-mode
Look through the variables once or something and set up some defaults

** TODO Unify insert heading and insert item keybinds
   Currently the insert heading keybinds look like this:

   - C-RET :: New heading, insert below subtree (respect content)
   - M-RET :: New heading, insert before subtree (don't respect content)


   And the insert item keybinds look like this:

   - M-RET :: Insert new item


   We should unify insert headings onto C-RET
* TODO Customise evil-mode
** TODO '/' text object not working correctly
Try using it on http://localhost:80/path/?query
* TODO Configure aggressive-fill-paragraph properly
Things to fix:
- It's activated in snippet buffers
* Extensions
** DONE Look at https://github.com/rranelli/auto-package-update.el
** TODO Look at http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/
** TODO Look at https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el
** TODO Look at https://github.com/abo-abo/pamparam
** TODO look into elfeed
https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed
** TODO Install the Emacs JSON serialisation package
** TODO Examples for `org-mode` and `evil-mode`
** HOLD Look at evil-cleverparens
** DONE gtypist-mode
This might prove useful in the future (along with the flash cards)
<2017-07-19 Wed> Apparently it's just a mode for editing tutorial files. Not
just the real thing.
** TODO Look into evil-quickscope to replace evil-snipe
** DONE ~evil-nerd-commenter~ defines comment text objects
CLOSED: [2017-07-24 Mon 01:08]
Though we probably need to perform a lot of rebinding because it does not use
~gc~ as its default unlike commentary
** TODO Implement your own comment text object
** TODO Figure out tagging implementations
