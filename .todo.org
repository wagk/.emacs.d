* TODO Remove uses of `:after` from use-packages
  [2017-07-14 Fri 01:56]
  `(require '*)` is better and probably what I actually want
* DONE Delete commented old configs in init.el
* DONE Get orgmode to recognise C-RET to insert headings in normal mode
  Rebound "RET" instead, since in terminals C-RET gets aliased to RET anyway
* TODO Bind org-capture-refile to a key
* TODO Figure out `org-agenda`
* TODO look into elfeed
  https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed
* TODO Pass arguments to helm search functions in `:vsp`
